The idea we will work on for the flutter course will be an application that detect academic writing mistakes and shows them.
The app is supposed to have the following features: take input text, Analyze text and show mistakes, Export report for the mistakes.

## Important Clarification
We have implemented that the app sends the text written by the user to an external API and show the mistakes in the text, but the API became broken suddenly so we had to comment all code parts that interact with the API and added a dummy data in the app tell the API return working again. Please consider this while grading our project because it happened suddenly and we are waiting for the API developers to solve the problem. You can see the commented code that connects to Network and interact with the API in our code files.
