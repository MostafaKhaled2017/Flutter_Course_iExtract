The idea we will work on for the flutter course will be an application that detect academic writing mistakes and shows them.
The app is supposed to have the following features:
<ul>
<li>Take input text</li>
<li>Analyze text</li>
<li>Show Mistakes</li>
<li>Supports Localisation</li>
<li>Allow Changing between LightTheme and DarkTheme</li>
</ul>

## Important Clarification
The API we are using does not respond sometimes and this is out of our control. After the user enters the text, if the API responded successfully the user will get a list for the mistakes in the text he entered, but If the API did not respond to the user request, a message will appear for the user and an example for a mistake will appear.<br><br>


## Demo Video for the App
To see the behaviour of the app when the API is responding and when it is not, please watch this <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ZG5qzWwdV4mJ8syChYHtvy6IpPOgC0cT/view?usp=sharing" style="font-weight: bold; font-size:20px;">video</a> <br>
